                The idea behind this game is to wake an awareness about the
                planet's wildlife. By playing this game you might gain some
                knowledge about the species that are very likely to become
                extinct. According to OneKind Planet: â€‹<br></br>
                <q>
                  Since 1996, the Amur leopard has been classified by the IUCN
                  as Critically Endangered with less than 70 individuals thought
                  to exist today. It is hunted and killed for its beautiful fur,
                  its habitat is being destroyed for human settlement and
                  agricultural practices.

                To access the game the user needs to create an account and login
                to the system. The user can then choose the level of the game
                (easy, medium and hard). The level decides how many animals will
                be shown on the screen
              </p>
              <TextTitle textsubTitle="Order the endangered animals" />
              <p>
                The user is supposed to order the species according to their
                threatening level based on the player's previous knowledge.
                After submitting the game, the user will get to know their
                result.

              <p>

                where the scores from other users are displayed. The About page
                shows a little description of the idea behind the game.
